# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Our good friend Steve just landed his first client as a Financial Advisor, his parents. So Steve wants to make sure he is giving his parents the best advice possible.

### Purpose
Steve's parents would like to invest in green energy companies and have decided on DAQO, New Energy Corporation. He is not sure about that paticular stock and its history of performance. We are going to help Steve compare this company with several others in the same field to make sure his parents investment is in the right stock. 
Once that is complete we will need to refactor our code to make it faster so Steve will know how long the process will take depending on the amount of data he decides to use in the future.

## Results
After running our inital code we found that DAQO was bot the best stock for Steve's parnets.
